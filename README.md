# Password-Generator

This application generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. The app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript.

To use the app, the user is prompted to choose a password length between 8 and 128 characters, and select the character types to include in the password: special characters, numeric characters, lowercase characters, and/or uppercase characters. The app validates user input and ensures that at least one character type is selected.

Once all prompts are answered, the app generates a password matching the selected criteria. The generated password is displayed on the webpage, and the user has the option to copy the password to their clipboard by clicking a button.

The app has a clean and polished user interface, is responsive to multiple screen sizes, and has been deployed to GitHub Pages for easy access.
